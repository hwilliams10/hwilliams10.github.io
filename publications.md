### Assessing oil sands consolidation parameters relative to long-term reclamation

Rourke, H. and Hockley, D. 2018. Tailings and Mine Waste 2018. Keystone, USA.

*The reclamation of tailings deposits is dependent upon long-term consolidation, which deter-mines both the final storage volume and ultimate deposit strength.  Very soft materials like floc-culated mature fine tailings undergo large deformations during consolidation.  Describing this “large strain consolidation” requires non-linear equations for compressibility and hydraulic conductivity as functions of void ratio or effective stress.  Typically, these equations are input to a finite strain consolidation model to estimate overall consolidation rates.  This paper presents a robust sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of material property functions and design vari-ables on consolidation model results.  The tested variables included compressibility constants, hydraulic conductivity constants, years of deposition, rate of rise, specific gravity, initial solids content, and surcharge load application.  Interpretation of the results identified clear patterns and dimensionless groupings that can be used as indicators of ultimate consolidation perfor-mance.*

### Limitations to the geotechnical properties of polymer-amended tailings”

Hockley, D. and Rourke, H. 2018. Presentation to COSIA 2018 Oil Sands Innovation Summit. Calgary, Canada

*The focus to date at oil sands operations has been on achieving stronger FFT by removing water and increasing the solids content.  Oil sands operators currently treat FFT with polymeric flocculants, followed by initial dewatering, thickening, centrifugation or air-drying.  These processes can result in significant increases in solids content. However, the further development of polymer-treated FFT into geotechnically viable material remains a challenge.* 

 *This study tested the following hypotheses:*
 - *There are fundamental limitations to the ability of polymer-treated FFT to consolidate, to drain or transmit water, and to gain strength*
 - *These limitations are due to colloidal and surface chemistry effects associated with FFT*
 - *The addition of polymer as is currently practiced does not address surface chemistry effects and may even exacerbates the associated limitations*
 - *The addition of both coagulant and polymer to FFT can produce materials with better geotechnical properties.* 

### The risks of excess water on tailings facilities and its application to dam break studies

Rourke, H. and Luppnow, D. 2015.  Tailings 2015. Sydney, Australia. 

*Recent disasters such as the failure of the Mount Polley tailings embankment remind us of the risks that tailings facilities pose. It is widely recognised that dam-break assessments are a vital tool in identifying the consequences of the failure of a facility, which in turn can be used to develop emergency action plans. A typical assessment includes an estimation of breach parameters and outflow volume, followed by the preparation of an inundation map to illustrate potential flow extents and downstream impacts. This paper focuses on the estimation of outflow volumes, which is an area that the authors feel can be improved. Presently, many types of analyses assume that the volume of tailings released is only a function of the storage volume and dam height. After a review of several documented tailings failures, it has been found that the extent and depth of the
supernatant pond needs to be considered as it is just as important, if not more so, as the storage volume and dam height. Tailings facilities with excess water storage have a higher risk of failure as
they are more susceptible to overtopping, piping and liquefaction failures. In addition, they pose greater failure consequences as the saturated conditions will lead to more material being mobilised.
This paper has reviewed available information on a number of tailings dam failures and proposes an alternative estimation of potential tailings release volumes as a function of supernatant water stored on the facility for use in dam-break analyses. In a broader sense, the paper seeks to shift the current risk paradigm from tailings dam heights to volumes of water stored and provides a basis for continuing research and discussion.*

### Best Practice Guidelines for Landbridge Closure

Rourke, H. and Linero, S. 2014. Article in the AusIMM Bulletin on Mine Rehabilitation

*Landbridges used in a mining environment can be defined as "structures constructed of earthen materials to facilitate access between high points in the natural landscape”. Landbridges are typically used for transportation within mining areas and can be constructed by end-tipping readily available fill such as waste rock.  Landbridges are similar to haul roads in that they are used for transportation within mining areas, and like waste dumps can be constructed by end-tipping waste rock fill.  However landbridges are unique structures that require special analysis because of their potential to impede watercourses..  Recently, SRK was approached by an operator seeking assistance in developing closure guidelines for landbridges at one of their operations. An extensive literature review found no current legislation, regulation, or industry best practice relating to the closure of these structures. This article details the framework that was developed to determine appropriate closure solutions for landbridges to achieve pre-defined closure objectives.*

### Liquefaction assessments of tailings facilities in low-seismic areas

Rourke, H. and Holmes, C. 2013. Tailings and Mine Waste 2013. Banff, Canada.

*ABSTRACT: It is widely recognised that piezocone (CPTu) testing is a valuable technique for identifying the in situ engineering properties of tailings for use in stability and liquefaction assessments. Nu-merous empirical procedures have been developed to relate the results of piezocone testing to liquefaction potential.  Appropriate assessments are particularly important for upstream raised tailings facilities which have an inherently higher risk of failure due to liquefaction following seismic events.  This paper evaluates two commonly used procedures developed by Robertson (2010), and Idriss & Boulanger (2008) for determining liquefaction potential.  These procedures calculate the factor of safety against liquefaction by comparing the cyclic resistance ratio (CRR) to the seismically induced cyclic stress ratio (CSR).  During the design of an upstream raise to a tailings facility in Western Australia, it was found that Robertson’s approach leads to improved estimates of the CRR by considering the influence of fines content.  Idriss & Boulanger’s rec-ommendation of a cut-off value for earthquake magnitude scaling factors and magnitude-dependent stress-reduction coefficients offers a more conservative estimate of the CSR, particu-larly where the design earthquake magnitude is less than 7. The case study identified a gap be-tween the methodologies for assessing the liquefaction potential for tailings facilities in areas with low seismicity that requires further research.*
